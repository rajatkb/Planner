# Planner
This is my personal repository , documenting and maintaining plans on what to study , how to study and also a good reminder of not slacking of. Plus since it is public , it may also help people who are in similar track. More importantly this is to organise my learning properly.  

Credits to [Priam Gogoi](https://github.com/rusty-electron/the-study-planner) though for the idea.  

## **Completed Stuff**
* ~~Udacity Pytorch course challenge by Facebook,~~
  ~~This one if done will result in a Deep Learning Nanodegree course.~~ YAY !!! I got in the Nanodegree.
* ~~Udacity **Deep Learning Nanodegree Shcolarship** (Jan - May) : Yup I got in among the top 300/10000. I am still not sure why or how. But it's on my top priority list now~~ Done, submmitted final stuff waiting on for graduating. Plus I may also get Reinforcement Learning Nanodgree if eligible.  

* **My final year 7th sem project**  
  ~~7th sem project done, working to have it published maybe : Link : (Handloom_Designing_Using_Generative_A.I)[https://github.com/rajatkb/Handloom-Design-Generation-using-Deep-Neural-Networks]~~ 

* **My final year 8th sem project**
  ~~8th sme project done, working on having it published : link : https://github.com/rajatkb/Intuition-Net_Segmentation-Outpainting-using-Video-Sequence~~

* Algorithms Specialization 
  Yup i kept it hanging on the side for a while.  
  


##### Machine Learning 

* Data Mining Specialization  
  I have this subject in college course this time and i love this subject so a good course from coursera should suffice me with the  
  understanding of the algorithms.  

* [Fast.ai](https://forums.fast.ai/) Machine Learning  
  Because I need revision and need involve myself with a community of learners. Yup these people are awesome. Plus need to try their
  recent fastai library
