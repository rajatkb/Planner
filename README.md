# Planner
This is my personal repository , documenting and maintaining plans on what to study , how to study and also a good reminder of not slacking of. Plus since it is public , it may also help people who are in similar track. More importantly this is to organise my learning properly.  

Credits to [Priam Gogoi](https://github.com/rusty-electron/the-study-planner) though for the idea.  

## **Completed Stuff**
* ~~Udacity Pytorch course challenge by Facebook,~~
  ~~This one if done will result in a Deep Learning Nanodegree course.~~ YAY !!! I got in the Nanodegree.


## **Ongoing Stuff :**

##### *Courses:*  

##### Date bounded #####
* Udacity **Deep Learning Nanodegree Shcolarship** (Jan - May) : Yup I got in among the top 300/10000. I am still not sure why or how. But it's on my top priority list now.  

* **Google Cloud Machine Learning Engineer** (Feb 19): The entire course is give free for a month till Feb 19. In my case. It's specialization. So I need to hurry up. Like really quick and In a jiffy. 

##### Unbounded ######
* Algorithms Specialization 
  Yup i kept it hanging on the side for a while. Plus I need to revise a lot for my GATE preps. So more the algorithm merier it is.

* Data Mining Specialization  
  I have this subject in college course this time and i love this subject so a good course from coursera should suffice me with the  
  understanding of the algorithms.  

* [Fast.ai](https://forums.fast.ai/) Machine Learning  
  Because I need revision and need involve myself with a community of learners. Yup these people are awesome. Plus need to try their
  recent fastai library

* Probabilistic Programming Specialization  
  Stanford Course , an awesome one at that

##### *Projects :*  

* **My final year project**  
  ~~7th sem project done, working to have it published maybe : Link : (Handloom_Designing_Using_Generative_A.I)[https://github.com/rajatkb/Handloom-Design-Generation-using-Deep-Neural-Networks]~~

## Reading List  

* **Deep Learning**  
  * [Deep learning paper reading list](http://deeplearning.net/reading-list/)
  * [Curated list of ML reading list](https://github.com/ujjwalkarn/Machine-Learning-Tutorials/blob/master/README.md#deep) , awesome list of awesome stuff in ML and DL. Plus some stats and optimization stuff  
  *  


## **Future Task **  

##### *Courses:*

* Statistic with R  
  I need some serious reskilling with my statistics. It is wobbly and bad. Though my work mostly been around Vision and one or two NLP projects  
  but most of the times the techniques used or maybe simple analysis done before i took for granted. No more that plus data scientist needs R  
  So this should be a good learning experience

* Move37
  Reinforcement Learning Course of Siraj Raval. The course videos can be better so stuck with learning from sepparate resources

* A.I by Kirril Emeriko 
  Reinforcment Learning Course again. This one is good but half done till now
